_**This document is still work in progress!**_

Until recently the IRMA token has always been a smart card as it offers very high levels of security. This focus allowed the IRMA system to thrive, but also imposed some restrictions on the system. Recently, we have been exploring other token carriers, like a smart phone. To enable working with the smart card, the interface has always been defined in terms of APDUs (the low level commands that you send to your smart card). However, when working with other tokens (for example a smart phone), this is not a natural interface.

We propose a new protocol here for requesting and sending disclosure proofs between the token and the verifier, and issuing credentials to the token, based on JSON instead of on APDU's.

# The setup

The workflow for the user should be as follows. Suppose she wants to watch a video on IrmaTube; we assume that she already has the proper credential on her token, which we assume to be the cardemu app for now (but see the section "Smart cards" below).

* The IrmaTube website displays a QR code as before,
* The user scans it,
* Her token either informs her that she does not have the required credentials or attributes, or asks her for permission to disclose the attributes that IrmaTube asked for. If she consents, her token sends a disclosure proofs to IrmaTube.

For code reusability and maintainability, it makes sense to split the logic of the website and the cryptography of verifying the credentials into separate projects. For that reason we have created the [`irma_api_server`](https://github.com/credentials/irma_api_server), which handles the cryptography and the communication with the token. This server sits between the service provider (the IrmaTube website in the example above) and the token, and generally works as follows.

* It accepts a disclosure proof request from the service provider (i.e., the IrmaTube website), and returns a session token.
* It is then the task of the service provider (the IrmaTube website) to inform the token of this session token and where to reach the `irma_api_server` - for example by using a QR code.
* The token connects to the `irma_api_server`, sending the session token. The `irma_api_server` informs the token of the required attributes. If the token does not possess these attributes, it aborts. Otherwise, it informs the user of the required attributes. If the user consents, the token creates the disclosure proof and sends it to `irma_api_server`.
* The `irma_api_server` verifies the proof. If anything went wrong, it reports failure. Otherwise, it sends the attributes contained in the proof back to the service provider (the IrmaTube website), in the form of a signed JSON web token.

Notice that the IrmaTube website now does almost nothing, apart from showing the QR-code; the token itself is responsible for informing its owner about what is happening. However, the service provider should be aware of the (RSA) public key with which `irma_api_server` signs the JSON web tokens, so that it can verify these.

# Smart cards

We can keep the smart cards in the game as follows:

* We build a translator that can translate our new protocol back and forth to APDU's.
* We endow the `irma_android_cardproxy` with this translator, and develop a similar desktop application for physical cardreaders that also uses this translator. These two apps can keep the user up-to-date through their GUI, but otherwise the card is authoritative.
* The service provider puts the URL to the verifier server in a new URL scheme like  `irma://something/something`
* The `irma_android_cardproxy` can scan QR codes like the cardemu can, but the desktop application will have to be notified of new sessions in some other way - perhaps the website explicitly shows the session key to the user, who can then copy and paste it into the desktop app.

# The protocol

## Verification

We first focus on the protocol between the `irma_api_server` and the token. We first define a _disclosure proof request_ data type, that looks as follows.

~~~ json
{
    "nonce": 123,
    "context": 456,
    "content": [
        {
            "label": "Over 18",
            "attributes": [
                "MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18",
                "Thalia.age.over18"
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
~~~

The `nonce` and `context` are optional large integers. Each entry of `content` is a disjunction of attributes, along with a label that can be shown to the user of the token. The disjunctions themselves should be ANDed together. Thus, this example asks for `MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18` or `Thalia.age.over18`.

Credential-only proofs are supported as follows. When one of the disjunctions contains an identifier of the form `issuer.credential` in the `attributes` list (for example, `MijnOverheid.ageLower`), the token should disclose none of the attributes contained in the credential apart from the metadata attribute. Since the metadata attribute is invisible to the user, this means that from the perspective of the user no attributes of the credential are disclosed, so that he only proves possession of the credential.

The `irma_api_server` is a web server listening at the following paths.

*   `POST /api/v2/verification`: accepts requests from
    service providers of the following form:

    ~~~ json
    {
        "data": "...",
        "validity": "60",
        "request": "..."
    }
    ~~~
    Here `data` can be any string of the service provider's choosing, while `request` is a disclosure proof request (without a nonce or context). `validity` specifies how long the returned JSON web token should be valid (in seconds). Only `request` is required, the other two are optional (the default value of `validity` is 60 seconds). In response, the server returns a JSON object of the form

    ~~~ json
    {
        "u": "...",
        "v": "2.0"
    }
    ~~~
    where `u` is the session token (`v` is a fixed value numbering the API version). It is the responsibility of the service provider to prepend the url to the api server to the session token `u`, so that the token knows where to find the api server, and then to forward this to the token.

*   `GET /api/v2/verification/verificationID`: if `verificationID` is a
    valid session token (i.e., it has been assigned to a disclosure proof request at some point in the past), the server generates a nonce, puts this in the disclosure proof request associated to this session token, and returns this to the token.
*   `POST /api/v2/verification/verificationID/proofs`: if `verificationID`
    is a valid session token, this accepts a serialized `ProofList` object, that contains one or more disclosure proofs (`ProofD`s). The proofs are verified immediately, and the server informs the client (i. e., the IRMA token, not the service provider) of the validity of the proofs in the form of a string.

    The service provider is informed of the result in the form of a JSON web token signed with our RSA private key. If the proofs verified, then this token contains the attributes. If there was no `validity` specified in the request from the service proider, the web token's validity is set to 60 seconds. If the `data` field was present then this is included in the web token in the [`jti` field](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7). For example, (the payload of) a returned JSON web token might look as follows.

    ~~~ json
    {
        "exp": 1448636691,
        "sub": "disclosure_result",
        "jti": "foobar",
        "attributes": {
            "MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18": "yes",
            "IRMAWiki.member.email": "stuifje@kuifje.nl",
            "MijnOverheid.fullName": "present"
        },
        "iat": 1448636631,
        "status": "VALID"
    }
    ~~~
    The last entry in the `attributes` map is the response to a credential-only request: it indicates that the `fullName` credential issued by `MijnOverheid` is present on the token.

    The `status` is the same value that is sent to the token, and can be one of the following:

    - `VALID`: the proofs were valid
    - `INVALID`: the proofs were invalid
    - `EXPIRED`: one or more of the proofs came from an expired credential
    - `MISSING_ATTRIBUTES`: not all required attributes were disclosed in the proofs
    - `WAITING`: if the token has not yet posted a proof

    Note: it is [important to verify](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/) that the JSON web token is actually signed with an RSA signature.

*   `DELETE /api/v2/verification/verificationID`: If the session
    exists it is deleted, and the service provider is informed of failure. Note that the token sends no reason, but this is what we want: the service provider does not need to learn if the user declined or if he does not have the required attributes.


## Issuing

The workflow here will be much the same as with disclosing. The `irma_api_server` sits between the token and the identity provider, handling all IRMA-specifics of issuing attributes to the token on behalf of the identity provider. In more detail, the following happens:

* The identity provider informs the `irma_api_server` that it wants to issue certain attributes with certain values to a token. These may be attributes from more than one credential-type. If the identity provider is authorized for this, and the `irma_api_server` has the appropriate Idemix secret keys, then the `irma_api_server` returns a session token.
* The identity provider informs the token of this session token, who then contacts `irma_api_server` mentioning the token. `irma_api_server` looks up the attributes that the identity provider wants issued and sends these (unsigned) to the token along with a nonce.
* If the token agrees to receive this credentials, then it engages in the Idemix issuing protocol with the `irma_api_server` normally, where the token uses this nonce in its first message.

Similarly to the disclosure proof request above, we define an _issuing request_ data type as follows:

~~~ json
{
    "nonce": 123,
    "context": 456,
    "credentials": [
        {
            "credential": "MijnOverheid.ageHigher",
            "expires": 1484481600,
            "attributes": {
                "over50": "yes",
                "over60": "no",
                "over65": "no",
                "over75": "no"
            }
        },
        ...
    ],
    "disclose": [
        {
            "label": "Over 18",
            "attributes": {
                "MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18": "yes",
                "Thalia.age.over18": "Yes"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
~~~

This indicates that we want to issue the `ageHigher` credential from `MijnOverheid`, that will expire on the corresponding Unix timestamp (which is in this case January 1 2017, 12:00 PM). In addition, the issuing will only happen if the token can satisfy the disclosure request in the `disclose` field (that is, in this case the token has to be able to show one of the two mentioned attributes with the corresponding value).

The server listens at the following paths.

*   `POST /api/v2/issue/`: accepts requests in the form of a JSON web token, whose payload should be of the form

    ~~~ json
    {
        "iss": "Identity provider name",
        "sub": "issue_request",
        "iat": 1453377600,
        "iprequest": {
            "data": "...",
            "timeout": 10,
            "request": "..."
        }
    }
    ~~~
    The fields mean the following:

    *   `iss` identifies the identity provider for the `irma_api_server` and the token. (`iss` is a standard JWT field, refering to the creator of the token, which in this case is, perhaps slightly confusing, the identity provider).
    *   `sub` is a fixed field whose value should be `issue_request`.
    *   `iat` is the time of the JWT creation. The server only accepts requests younger than a certain cutoff.
    *   `data` can be any string of the issuer's choosing.
    *   `request` is an issuing request as defined above (without a nonce or context).
    *   `timeout` specifies how long, in seconds, the server should wait for a token to contact it, before considering the issuing request failed.

    The server keeps a list of public keys for the verification of incoming JSON web tokens; it uses the `iss` field to lookup the appropriate public key.

    Of the `iprequest` field, only `request` is required, the other three are optional (the default value of `timeout` is 10 seconds). In response, the server returns a JSON object of the form

    ~~~ json
    {
        "u": "...",
        "v": "2.0"
    }
    ~~~
    where `u` is the session token (`v` is a fixed value numbering the API version). It is the responsibility of the service provider to prepend the url to the api server to the session token `u`, so that the token knows where to find the api server, and then to forward this to the token.
*   `GET /api/v2/issue/issueID`: if `issueID` is a valid session token (i.e., it has been assigned to an issuing request
    request at some point in the past), the server generates a nonce, puts this in the issuing request associated to this session token, and returns this to the token.
*   `POST /api/v2/issue/issueID/commitments`: if `issueID` is a valid session token, then this accepts the token's
    commitments to its secret key, one for each credential type that will be issued, in the form of a serialized
    `IssueCommitmentMessage`. (This data type contains a `ProofList` instance; it is important that the proofs contained
    in that list are in the same order as the credentials in the `credentials` object of the issuing request. If the issuing request included the disclosure(s) of other credential(s), then this `ProofList` should contain the corresponding disclosure proof(s)).

    The `irma_api_server` verifies the correctness of the commitments using the included zero-knowledge proofs. If they
    are valid, and if the appropriate attributes were correctly disclosed, then it computes the corresponding Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures for each of the credentials, and returns
    these to the token, in the form of a list of `IssueSignatureMessage`s.
*   `DELETE /api/v2/issue/issueID`: If the session exists it is deleted, and the identity provider is informed of failure.


## Attribute-based signatures
Besides just disclosure proofs, we can also use IRMA to produce attribute-based
digital signatures [1].

[1] : [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~brinda/publications/Space-paper.pdf](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~brinda/publications/Space-paper.pdf)

Most of the times, it is important to know with _which_ attributes a statement is
signed: this will describe the role of the signer. A person could for example
sign a document using his/her name, but also only using the fact that he/she is
over 18 and thus old enough to sign a contract.

To determine the required attributes, a signature specification is used: this
specification determines how a certain statement is signed in the same way as a
disclosure proof request determines which attributes are used in a disclosure
proof. If a service provider needs a signature from a user, it has to send this
signature specification to the irma_api_server. 

An example signature specification looks as follows:

~~~json
{
    "message" : "Message to be signed",
    "messageType" : "STRING",
    "nonce"   : "Nonce, will be combined with context and message hash to get challenge",
    "context" : 456,
    "content": [
        {
            "label": "Over 18",
            "condition" : "yes",
            "attributes": [
                "MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18",
                "Thalia.age.over18"
            ],
            "conditions" : [
                { "MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18" : "yes"},
                { "Thalia.age.over18" : "ja" }
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
~~~

Like with the disclosure proof request data type, the `nonce` and `context` are
optional large integers. Each entry of `content` is a disjunction of attributes,
along with a label that can be shown to the user of the token. The disjunctions
themselves should be ANDed together. Besides the attributes, we can also require
optional conditions on the values of the attributes. If these are present, then
the signer (the token) is required to have the attribute values specified in the
conditions. If not, then the signature won't be acceptd by the irma_api_server.

We have two type of conditions: _global_ and _local_ conditions. Global
conditions need to hold for all the selected attributes in the disjunction,
where local conditions are specified on a per-attribute basis. Note that local
conditions override global conditions: if a local conditions for an attribute is
specified, then it will override the global `default'.

If `messageType` contains the keyword _STRING_, then the `message` must contain
a string that is the message that will be signed with the specified attributes.
In the future, the messageType could be expanded with for example 'PDF'. In that
case, the message field could contain a URL to a PDF file, which can be retrieved 
and signed instead.

Like with the disclosure proofs, the irma_api_server will listen to the
following paths:

*   `POST /api/v2/signature`: accepts requests from
    service providers of the following form:

    ~~~ json
    {
        "data": "...",
        "validity": "60",
        "request": "..."
    }
    ~~~
    This is the same type of request as /api/v2/verification, but the request
    data type needs to be a signature specification instead of a disclosure proof
    request. In response, the server returns a JSON object of the form:

    ~~~ json
    {
        "u": "...",
        "v": "2.0"
    }
    ~~~
    where `u` is the session token, like with the disclosure proofs.

*   `GET /api/v2/signature/verificationID`: if `verificationID` is a
    valid session token (i.e., it has been assigned to a signature specification
    at some point in the past), the server generates a nonce, puts this in the
    request associated to this session token, and returns this to the token.

*   `POST /api/v2/signature/verificationID/proofs`: if `verificationID`
    is a valid session token, this accepts a serialized `ProofList` object, that
    contains one or more disclosure proofs (`ProofD`s). The proofs are verified
    immediately, and the server informs the client (i. e., the IRMA token, not the
    service provider) of the validity of the proofs in the form of a string. Note
    that this disclosure proof must be a signature proof (so the message should be
    contained in the challenge of the proof).

    The service provider is informed of the result in the form of a JSON web
    token signed with our RSA private key, like in the case of diclosure proofs.
    But this token also contains the signature, which allows the service provider to
    store this for later use (i.e. storing a renting contract).

    ~~~json
    {
        "exp": 1448636691,
        "sub": "signature_result",
        "jti": "foobar",
        "attributes": {
            "MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18": "yes",
            "IRMAWiki.member.email": "stuifje@kuifje.nl",
            "MijnOverheid.fullName": "present"
        },
        "iat": 1448636631,
        "status": "VALID",
    	"signature" : "Serialized prooflist",
    	"message" : "The message that has been signed by this signature",
        "messageType" : "string",
        "nonce"   : "Nonce, will be combined with context and message hash to get challenge",
        "context" : 456,
        "condition" : { "Global condition" },
        "conditions" : { // Disjunctionlist with conditions, optional and only needed if conditions on attributes are enforced
        }
    }
    ~~~
    The conditions are additionally included, because storing these ensures that the
    right conditions are met if the signature is verified later on. The nonce,
    context, message and messageType are also included because they are needed to
    verify the signature.

*   `DELETE /api/v2/signature/verificationID`: If the session
    exists it is deleted, and the service provider is informed of failure. Note
    that the token sends no reason, but this is what we want: the service provider
    does not need to learn if the user declined or if he does not have the required
    attributes.

*   `POST /api/v2/signature/checksignature`:
    This is a simple stateless api request that allows a service provider to
    check a signature without having IRMA software. It accepts a signature, as
    returned in the json web token and returns a status (with the same structure as
    the status object that has been included in the json web token).
    Note that a session token is not needed to execute
    this request. Also note that the response on this request is not signed with
    the api_server's private key: this still needs to be implemented.

### Intermezzo: technical context about challenge

This section contains some technical context. If you just want to use the
protocol, you can skip this. TODO: move this section to somewhere
else?

An attribute-based signature is still a disclosure proof with a modified
nonce. The nonce is now calculated as:
```
    nonce = sha256(nonce, sha256(message))
```

As in the original paper explained, this double hashing seems unneccesary but it
allows us to keep the changes to the existing IRMA infrastructure to a minimum.

Like with disclosure proofs, this calculated nonce will be concatenated with
the context and asn1-encoded to obtain the challenge:
```
    challenge = asn1(sha256(context,nonce))
```

The asn1 encoding makes sure that we have a clear separation between IRMA
disclosure proofs and IRMA signatures: in the case of signatures, we additionaly
encode a boolean, which is set to true, in front of the challenge. This was in
the original paper proposed as the `dbit`.

# To do

* Authentication between `irma_api_server` and the service provider
* Review of current signature proposal
* Remove double hashing from signatures?
* Sign data with web token on the /signature/checksignature api
* SP authentication with signature sessions (already done for verification by Sietse)
* Some code clean up (mostly duplicated code between verification and signatures that can be combined)
